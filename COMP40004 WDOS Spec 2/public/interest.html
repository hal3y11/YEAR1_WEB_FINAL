                        Cloud computing is a technology that enables users to access and store data, and use computing
                        resources
                        over the internet, rather than having to have physical hardware and software on-site. It
                        operates on a
                        pay-as-you-go or subscription basis, allowing businesses and individuals to scale up or down
                        based on
                        their
                        needs without the upfront cost of purchasing and maintaining hardware. Cloud computing
                        encompasses
                        various
                        services, including software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and
                        infrastructure as a
                        service (IaaS), each providing different levels of control, flexibility, and management. This
                        technology
                        supports a wide range of applications, from email and web hosting to data analysis and
                        artificial
                        intelligence, making it a cornerstone of modern IT solutions.
